good

- matching people on same ride
- route editor
    - creating routes from rides
    - selecting streets, trails
- competitive spirit
    - profile comparison with other athletes
    - segment ranks
    - ranks in clubs

meh

- challenges
- athlete posts

underdeveloped

- clubs
    - promote those that are active
        - most don't post anything
- races
    - socializing around races
    - crowd-sourcing races
    - more types, including cycling, triathlons
- communication around rides
    + comments
        + threading
    + sharing photos
- fly-by's
    - can't reliably find people I rode with for a while

missing

- planning rides outside of clubs
- support for all kinds of sportspeople, not just runner or cyclist -- ie. triathlete
- route search
    - tagging by type
- proper race database
- better embedding of rides
- turn by turn navigation in app
    - perhaps better left to specialists like Garmin

money

- go more the meetup.com way rather than charge for analytics
