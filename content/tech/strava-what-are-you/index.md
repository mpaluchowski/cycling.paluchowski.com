Strava is having a crisis. It may not know it, it may even deny it vehemently, but it's clear that Strava does not know what it is or what it wants to be. They have a few cool things and lots of half-baked stuff that desperately needs attention. Without it, there's no incentive to pay them, no money and ultimately, a sell-out or shutdown.

<!--more-->

I'm actually a Strava Summit member, which means I'm paying them for a bunch of extra features that I barely use. I am paying, though, so that they stick around because I generally like what they're doing. It has a number of unique features that I enjoy greatly, plus it's disconnected from any specific hardware vendor.

## What's good?

The killer feature is matching people on the same ride. I join a group of cyclists, we do a ride together and then I see whom I rode with and can stay in touch if it so happens that I had a good chat with someone. It's automatic, it's reliable and it's great. Strava would've been worth signing up for even if it only had this feature.

On top of that there's an experimental feature called "Flybys", which lets me check out people I passed on the way. Maybe someone had a fancy bike, or I got on someone's wheel for a while and wanted to thank them later. It's possible, as long as Strava has the other person's ride registered. As with all experimental features, it's not fully reliable nor very easy to use, but functional enough nonetheless.

Then there's the route editor, better than any other I tried. There are apps dedicated to planning, storing and sharing bike routes, but none of them has an editor as efficient as Strava's. The map's view is clean (if not particularly fresh[^1]), the editor chooses the exact routing very reasonably when I choose the next point, rerouting is a simple and clean act of dragging & dropping an existing route. I'm using this editor for all my planning and then manually export these routes to Garmin or elsewhere.

Finally, there's the competitive spirit---if that's your cup of tea. It's not mine, perhaps because I'm far, far away from the top locations anywhere, but I do appreciate the whole concept. Every club has a rank list, every segment too, with sublists for the men, women, age groups, years etc. Plus, opening a profile of any other athlete gives me a comparison of current stats, ie. how long the person rides weekly on average, compared to me. There are a lot of people who live by those rankings.

## What's "meh"?

Some features are a waste of space. Athlete posts are the best example, which I raged about previously. I've yet to see people read or publish those.

Challenges are also something that sounds like a good idea, but the way it works right now, it really isn't. People seem to just mindlessly join those challenges, and most of them---those that are advertising actions of different brands---aren't challenging at all. Anyone who's a reasonably active cyclist can ride a total of 100-150km in three weeks or a month. Some, like the monthly Gran Fondo or Climbing Challenge, are tougher, but then again, getting a badge is just that. You have another marker on your profile and that's it.

## What need to improve?

A number of features are good beginnings that are begging for more work and attention.

Firstly, communication around rides is all but missing. There's a simple, single-threaded commenting feature, where everything is public, and that's that. How about sharing photos between ride participants? Talking just among the group that rode together? What if I could schedule a ride with the same group for another time?

Clubs are a very fine idea, where people can schedule rides and have some basic communication. The vast majority I saw, though, were inactive. No events, no discussions, nothing. Strava should promote the ones that are active and bury the dead ones. Plus, help people find clubs around them. If there's a club that's regularly meeting for rides somewhere near me, I want to know about it.

Then there's a database of running races. More of a shortlist really, because it's a dozen or two of races listed, with on way to add new ones. Why not develop it into a proper database? Add cycling races (and triathlons and others). Let people submit races, let those races promote themselves (and charge them!), let clubs link their events to races to schedule joint starts.

## What's completely missing?

There's no way to plan group rides outside clubs. I've a few friends I'd love to schedule a private ride with, and do it on Strava, but we're not going to start a club just for that.

Support for sports is really limited only to running and cycling. You can choose either of these sports as your "primary" in the profile, but what if you're an triathlete or swimmer? It doesn't take much do support those on top of the existing features.

Routes created with Strava's editor can be saved in one, long, paged, chronologically-sorted list. It's unusable for any amount larger than two pages. There's no way to limit the routes, ie. by length or region, no way to tag them ie. as road, gravel or off-road routes. With such a great editor, this area begs for development.

Some people would add here, that the mobile app should have turn-by-turn navigation, not just recording activities. Strava is rejecting this on purpose and maybe that's better so. Doing navigation is no easy business, and if Strava is to focus, they're better off leaving that to specialists.

## Where will the money come from?

As with any VC-backed business, Strava's efforts are probably aiming at "monetizing" their user base, and either achieving profitability or selling out. Their current income streams are special challenges and brand-owned clubs, plus possibly branded posts, but that's all advertising, and it always creates awkward incentives for the company, because their users become the product rather than customers.

They do offer the Summit, which has three packages adding a number of features. I found these vaguely useful, and judging by the number of people who are paying for these (Strava makes these public on people's profiles), I'm not alone in my judgement. It's not about the money, because each pack is now less than a Starbucks latte in cost.

What I'm thinking is Strava could do better following a model like meetup.com, which would mean building excellent features for organizing group events, then charging the organizers reasonably for access to them. I can easily see big sports brands, as well as local bike shops, creating their own groups and using the tools to stay in touch with their customers, by organizing them into joint sports groups.


All the above is nothing brilliant. Anyone who's an active user of Strava could think of most of the above suggestions, and add some more. And I'm sure there are at least some people at Strava, who know these. Why aren't they acting on them? That's a mystery for me. That's suggesting that there's someone on top of Strava, who's pulling the strings, who is actively steering the service away from user-focused features and into wasteful efforts like Athlete Posts.

Whatever money Strava raised so far, it's not going to last forever, and I doubt their current activities are bringing in enough to cover all their costs. What I fear is that one day they'll announce that they're selling the service to someone like Garmin, which may either save them---if the buyer adopts the best features, develops them and drops the rest---or kill them---depending on who the buyer is and why they'd buy the Service. Time will tell.
