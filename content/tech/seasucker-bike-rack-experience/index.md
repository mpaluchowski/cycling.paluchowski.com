Cycling away from home is one of my biggest joys in this sport. The SeaSucker bike rack has been my ally in this regard, helping me transport my bicycle to distant places. It's practical, reliable, if you don't mind a few quirks, but not necessarily something I would pay full price for.

## How's the hold?

The first question that comes to mind is: will it hold? If I go on the highway and drive up to the limit of 140kph, what's the risk that my previous bicycle will fly off and crash with great speed on the asphalt, possibly causing a wreckage of cars behind it?

That's clearly the same thought on everyone's mind who's considering using a SeaSucker. It must be their customer's chief concerns, because most of their advertising is circling around how durable the hold is:

In all the travels I had with the rack so far, it held well. I drove in scorching heat, in the rain, and at times as fast as 160-170kph, and nothing came off. Admittedly, I was still paranoid about it and kept checking and adjusting the vacuum pads every time we stopped---which is exactly what the manufacturer advises.

Once I had trouble producing vacuum with one of the pads, had to locate the side of it that wasn't fitting the car roof and hold it down. Then it held.

## Convenience of mounting

The racks can be mounted on any surface---horizontal, vertical or otherwise. If you own a van, track or SUV, you may want to mount it on the rear of your car, but for most vehicles it'll be the roof. This has the disadvantage of having to lift bikes high to mount them, and once you arrive, having to clean them thoroughly from all the insects they've collected on the way. I personally despise that.

The roof-mounted position also devastates your car's aerodynamics (you know what I mean, if you're a serious cyclist). Fuel consumption goes up and there's an upsetting, swooshing sound at higher speeds.

Mounting is quick and easy. Removal is even easier---you just lift one of the vacuum pad's sides and poof! vacuum's gone. In fact, it's so easy that the racks are trivial to steal, with or without the bikes attached to them.

This may well be the devices' biggest flaw---there's no (reasonable) way of locking the bikes to prevent, or delay, thievery. The company's own advice for security is laughable: use a cable! and [buy their window cable anchor][cable-anchor] to fixate it to the vehicle.

## Would I buy it?

I'm not sure. To date I've always been renting them and haven't decided to buy one so far.

They're expensive. Approx. €400 for the one-bike model is two-three times as much as a regular rack would cost. The three-bike Bomber model costs twice as much.

On the upside, they can be used with any car, so if we change cars or take another car, ie. rented one, we could still use them. And they're much smaller than regular racks, making it easier to store them at home.

I like to act in a data-based fashion though, meaning: do I use it often enough to justify buying? So far, no. I used it four times this year, each one for approx. €25 rental, totalling €100, which is still a lot less than a new one costs. And I don't need to store it, or service, or worry about it in any matter.

Maybe the next time we change cars, we'll have a towbar mounted to it, and rent racks that fit onto it. These are both cheaper to rent than a SeaSucker, and much more convenient aerodynamically. They'd be a pain to store at home, but as long as we're renting, that won't be an issue.
