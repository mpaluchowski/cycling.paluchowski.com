Strava seems to be in a tricky transition, from one-of-many sports apps into the world's first, proper social network for athletes. I find that very welcome, but the way they're trying to get there---by asking people to post crappy content on the platform via the new [Athlete Posts][athlete-posts-social] is just copying what all other social networks are doing. And it won't help them become a feasible company.

Eight years after founding, Strava is still likely burning more money than they're making. We can't know for sure, since they're a private company and not disclosing financial results, but they [already had six funding rounds][crunchbase-strava] for a total of over $40M, the latest one just lately, [in February 2017][strava-series-e-funding].

They're making money from two sources: selling [Premium subscriptions][strava-premium], unlocking a couple of additional features, and selling aggregate data from the logged activities to other organizations. The latter has limited growth potential, so the first source should be their aim---by building a product users would be _willing_ to pay for.

Now if I'm about to part with some of my money, I want something in return. With web tools, I want either that they'll save me time, or that they'll make something, that so far has been hard or impossible, easy.

Now look at these Athlete Posts:

* if someone, like myself, _wants_ to post about their sport, they're likely already doing this somewhere on the web. I won't bother using a second platform for my publishing, and God forbid I would use it exclusively, binding the future of my content to the fate of Strava.
* from a content consumer's standpoint, they're more likely to _waste_ my time than save it. They'll appear in the timeline, take up screen real estate, need to be scrolled past or, at least, filtered out via some setting.

They neither save time nor make anything easier. I'm actually _less_ likely to pay for the Premium account after I get swamped in some irrelevant content.

The reason most other social networks invite adding content to their platforms is to boost the magical "engagement" factor---causing people to spend more time on their websites and interact more with the futures. Because they're making money from advertising, so the more time people spend on the websites, the more (and better-tailored) ads they'll see, and the more the networks will earn.

Strava doesn't have any advertising. Thankfully. But it's a slippery slope from here---inviting content and trying to make money. They'll eventually be _bound_ to consider advertising as an income stream.

## If not content, then what?

There's plenty of opportunity to make the platform more social. The sports its covering are, by their virtue of being individual, pretty solitary. You _can_ run or ride in a group, but very often you'll be training alone. Strava can make it easier for athletes to connect, both with the people we already know, but also with new friends we could make.

Some ideas from the top of my head:

* improve discussion features around activities. Right now they're simple, single-level comments. Add @mentions and easy referencing other entities---activities, routes, segments, etc.
* help us stay in touch after a joint ride or run. Let us share pictures within the riders' group, contact each other directly.
* cater for multi-sport athletes, triathletes in particular. Right now I can only set my primary sport to cycling _or_ running. The activity list I embed on my website will only show either activity. Swimming has practically no support for analyzing a training.
* how about public events? Right now they're only available inside clubs, but why can't I find rides or runs in my neighborhood, that are open to anyone?
* open the [race database][strava-races] to crowdsourcing. I'd love to be able to find events there, if only the list was more complete, rather than search other websites.

Right now a _lot_ of social activity around sports is happening in Facebook groups, with their generic community features and nothing tailored to athletes. All these discussions, scheduling, planning, recalling, could and should be happening on Strava instead. And _none_ of it involves anything that resembles Athlete Posts.
