title: Road Cycling's Explosion in Warsaw

I can't figure this one out. Did the vast and vibrant community of road cyclists in Warsaw (and elsewhere) just _pop up_ and mushroom in the last three years, or was it always there, of which I had no idea until I became part of it?

<!--more-->

I always __thought about road bikes as racing machines__, built for and used by a small group of professional cyclists participating in Tour de Somethings of the world. The only time I saw a road bicycle used by a non-pro was a colleague of mine from school, back in the early 90s.

Then, in 2015, I turned to racing triathlons and consequently decided to buy a road bike. Because that's what they're meant to be used for, right?

On the roads around Warsaw I started meeting other cyclists. Whole packs of them. Not the leisurely Sunday mom-and-kids type, but properly clothed people on decent bikes with blade-thin tires and (charakterystyczna kierownica). And they were _fast_. Kept passing me, individuals and groups. Sometimes I would join a group that wasn't too fast, and interestingly they would welcome me as if it was the most natural thing to do. Some of these people were in their sixties, and they were often passing me too.

How come I never saw any of those people before? I don't remember seeing a single road bike between the 90s and 2015 in any other setting than a race. (Which could, of course, be the [Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon](https://www.damninteresting.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/) in action.)

My wife made jokes about how much time and money I'm spending on the bike (thankfully, she's also a triathlete and mostly understanding), so when I stumbled upon a feature in The Economist on [how men in mid-life crises turn to expensive bikes][economist-midlife-crisis] these days, rather than cars, I immediately shared that with her for a laugh. From that feature I learned about Strava (oh, here's how I can meet other sportspeople?), which I [immediately joined][strava-profile], and Rapha, with their [amazing movies from cycling trips][rapha-travel] (and overpriced garmets).

Clearly there were people, for whom road cycling was an intergral part of life. Rapha runs clubs in various locations around the world. They're not the only company in business. There's a similar company in Poland called [Podia][podia] and one in Czechia called [Festka][festka].

In Warsaw, the [AirBike chain of bicycle shops][airbike] is gradually building up a community following. Their [Wilanów location][airbike-wilanow] is also an aspiring café (missing seating though) and the meeting spot for [organized group rides][airbike-wilanow-events]. Last year there was only one, rather fast, group each Saturday---and I joined them, biking through the winter---this year there's another, beginner group, plus a Wednesday ladies-only "fast" ride and just-announced Thursday, again ladies-only, "easy gossip" ride. All that in addition to many informal groups organizing themselves on Strava or Facebook.

I'm blown away. Where just two-three years ago there was nothing, or at least nothing I was aware of, there's now this whole hive of activity. The only element we're missing is a proper clubhouse---a quality place for cyclists to spend time, with bike stands (duh!), good coffee, snacks, biking memorabilia decor, TVs to screen races, and lots of events to get people together. Ideally along one of the popular cycling routes of Warsaw. Or maybe there already is such a place, that I haven't heard of yet?
