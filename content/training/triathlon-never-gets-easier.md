I thought the top athletes in our sport are somehow gifted. Not so much for the results they achieve, because they've obviously been training _something_ all their lives, but for the ease with which they endure long races---70.3s and full IronMans. Turns out I was wrong.

<!--more-->

Exhibit A is the recent Kona finisher, professional triathlete, Jesse Thomas, who's [race recap starts with "CRAZY ASS FANS. That was hard."][jesse-thomas-kona-recap] then goes into details, on the bike: "I started hurting and cramping a bit", mid-run: "I started having a bit of stomach trouble", finally, shortly past mid-run:

> Then, as happens in almost all my races, and particularly in the hot races, I cramped, and cramped bad. I tried to run through it—sometimes I can—but this one like many others was no way no how. I stopped to stretch and walk it out. That mile was slow obviously. The heat set in, and as I went by mile 14 I cramped again and it became pretty clear my body was shutting down big time. My stomach started lurching a bit and energy dropped as well.

> I literally could not physically run, or even jog, or even walk, because of the cramps. Of the dozen or so I had, a few were those ridiculously annoying ones that force you to stop, and then __as you try to stretch it, the opposite muscle cramps__! It was a freaking nightmare. [emphasis mine]

I laughed reading through the whole part about the run, because the cramps Jesse reported were _exactly_ like the ones I had during last August's IronMan 70.3 Gdynia and later at [IronDragon Kraków]({{< relref "races/iron-dragon-2017/recap.md" >}})---debilitating, on both sides of both legs, and resistant against any attempts at stretching.

I was relieved to see that people, who were aiming at finishing in the top 10, struggle with the same problems I do. The [whole text][jesse-thomas-kona-recap] is a good read for everyone beating themselves up for not having trained enough when a long race turns out harder than expected. And if you're still not convinced, consider exhibits B and C:

* Jan Frodeno, this year's Kona's favorite, [barely finished the run due to injury][triathelte-kona-recap],
* Daniela Ryf, third time Kona winner, [called it the "hardest win I've ever had"][triathlete-kona-daniela-ryf]. Back in May she reported [how challenging it was for her to complete the run at Challenge Roth][ryf-challenge-roth].

Yup, it never gets easier. Years of consistent training may bring us faster to the finish line, but we'll always be balancing on the edge between giving all we have and falling apart on the way, limping towards the finish line on the bare strength of our will.
