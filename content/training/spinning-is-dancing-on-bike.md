- autumn
    + don't mind the cold
        * been riding all last winter
    + shorter days, evening rides out
- rainy season
    + lower chance of a dry weekend or day for biking
- spinning's a good alternative
    + exhilirating due to the music
    + regulating my own effort
- clases at Calypso Ursyn√≥w
    + 2-3 at a time
