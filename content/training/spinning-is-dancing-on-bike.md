I must be looking silly in spinning classes. The music's better than at most dance parties, I'm pedaling in sync with the beat, and the effort releases a heady endorphin rush. Can't help but bang my head and swing my hips when a particularly good song reaches its chorus.

Autumn barely just started and it's already in full swing. We had a full week of rain, including this current weekend. It doesn't make cycling impossible---they say there's no bad weather, just bad clothing---but I realized long ago that __I derive no pleasure from returning home covered head to toes in mud__. Like the group of guys, I occasionally ride with [did yesterday][strava-ride-tts].

Cold I don't mind. I've been cycling all previous winter, including a [fun ride on New Year's Eve][strava-new-years-eve-ride]:

It's been very pleasantly tranquil with few other bikers on the usually crowded routes. So, as long as it's dry, there's no snow nor ice on the road, and above -5C, I'll be cycling outside. For the other days---the wet, snowy or ice-covered ones---I found a great alternative in spinning classes.

There are a few different spinning variants, some including doing weird, push-up-like exercises on the bikes, but I stick to the regular "Spinn Bike" or just "Spinning" ones. These __offer a good mix of endurance with strength and anaerobic intervals__.

Yes, it's sweating on a stationary bike in a closed room. That'll never match the experience of being out on the tarmac. But when weather conditions are hostile, this is the next best thing. And I much prefer doing it in a gym, in a group, than home alone, on a trainer. Plus, the music more than makes up for the lack of horizon. It's _exhilarating_.

The coach keeps telling us to synchronize pedaling with the beat of the songs---whether it's a fast-beat "flatland" or a slow-beat "climb" tune. This literally __makes the training feel like dancing.__ Because that's _exactly_ what you do when dancing---move your body to the beat. And somehow my coach keeps playing music that I genuinely enjoy. Today we had a selection of hits from the 90s that made feel twenty years younger. When [Bomfunk MC's "Freestyler"][freestyler-youtube] came on I almost _melted_.

There's the additional benefit of __self-regulated effort__. Every bike has its own knob for regulating friction, and therefore pedaling effort. When I want a heavily strength-oriented session, I turn it up; when I prefer a steady, aerobic endurance ride, I turn it down. No need to look for hills nor flat road segments, and no incentive to race anyone around me.

My local gym, [Calypso Ursyn√≥w][calypso-ursynow], has perfectly scheduled spinning classes---three in a row on both Saturday and Sunday mornings. I can attend one, two, or all three at a time, depending on my mood and goals. They also, unsurprisingly, have lots of treadmills, so later I'm planning to try doing bricks there.
