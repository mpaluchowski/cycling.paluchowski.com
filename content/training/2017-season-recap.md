Last weekend's [Iron Dragon race]({{< relref "/races/iron-dragon-2017/_index.md" >}}) was the last of my 2017 season. It's finished now and for the next few weeks I'll be off structured training. I need rest, mostly mentally, because physically I haven't trained nearly as hard as I was planning to, crippled by injuries and various obstacles.

Only after my failure at Iron Dragon did I realize __how much of a toll the past season took on my psyche__. I had to endure lengthy periods of not being able to train, waiting for injuries to heal, then when I _could_ train, kept worrying about injuries re-appearing. The week after Iron Dragon I didn't feel like training anymore _at all_. I logically knew I would, but emotionally felt otherwise.

I'll use the next few weeks to __bring back the fun into my fitness routine__. Cycle again with the [Saturday AirBike group][airbike-cycling-group]. Run for leisure, through the parks and forests of Warsaw. Get back in the gym to work on my physique. No intervals, no pace nor heartrate targets.

## Mixed performance

I only did three races this season:

* __Bieg dla Par (Couples' Run) in February__, at crisp -7C, together with my wife, I ran my fastest 5K ever. Might've been due to the excellent cooling.
* __IronMan 70.3 Gdynia in August__, the highlight of my season. The physically toughest thing I ever attempted and one I wasn't sure I would finish, but I did!
* __Iron Dragon Kraków in September__, meant to be the grand closing of the season on home turf, with my family cheering. Turned into three hours of suffering.

Training was going very well until early March, when an extended run caused a week-long pain in my right knee. I finally took to a sports orthopaedist, who sent me to physiotherapy, which taught me how to stretch and improve my mobility. I stretched _a lot_ this season and might be done with the knee problem by now. We'll see.

Then in early April I got sciatica, while doing exercises to fix my knee problems. This one took until mid-July to heal properly.

Add to that the six weeks I spent in travel, between March and July I was on and off training, stopping, then restarting at low intensity. Just when I should've been cranking it up for the starting race season.

Evaluating the 2017 season, I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, there are the failures and injuries. On the other, there's the IronMan 70.3 finish that, given the conditions, I'm very happy about. It's enough to keep me in the sport and keep moving forward.

## Thoughts for the 2018 season

I won't be doing detailed planning for next year's season just yet. I do have some rough ideas, though:

* I __need to fix my swimming.__ It's my number one limiter now. I tried working on my own and results are nil. Time to get a coach.
* I might be __joining a triathlon training group__, mostly to access professional coaching. [Kuźnia Triathlonu][kuznia-triathlonu] looks good, but I'm also looking at [TriWawa][triwawa] and [Trinergy][trinergy] in Warsaw.
* It's time to __have a fitness assessment__ and map out my heart rate zones properly, rather than estimate them as I did until now.
* Hoping to do __three triathlons next season__, a sprint, an olympic distance and the IronMan 70.3 in Gdynia again.
* I'll __join running races__ in autumn, winter and spring, possibly finishing with the March half-marathon in Warsaw.

We'll see how much of the above life will actually let me do. We continue trying to conceive with my wife, and when that succeeds, I'm fully expecting the time I now have available for training to get _wiped out_. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. For now I'll be enjoying my time off and doing a bit of running in preparations for the [October 1 Biegnij Warszawo]({{< relref "/races/biegnij-warszawo-2017/_index.md" >}}).
