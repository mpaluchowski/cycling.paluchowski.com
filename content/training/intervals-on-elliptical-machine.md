I got injured. Again, I know. This time it's a different leg part though. And I'm trying out a new way of maintaining, perhaps even building fitness, by doing intervals on the elliptical machine.

The injured part this time is my left foot. I reported three weeks ago, [recapping the Biegnij Warsawo race]({{< relref "races/biegnij-warszawo-2017/recap.md" >}}), that my ankle was painful in the morning and that I decided to race nonetheless. Unsurprisingly, it the ankle felt worse the next day, but not drastically. I thought I'd be fine within a week or two, which isn't a huge price to pay for a good race.

While the ankle seems mostly fine by now, what started bugging me last week was the mid-outer part of my foot. A sharp pain when I tested jumping, landing on it, and always after a while of not moving it. From the symptoms it might be a stress fracture, which means time off running for six weeks. Uh. Just in time when I signed up for another [10K at Bieg Niepodległości in November]({{<relref "/races/bieg-niepodleglosci-2017/_index.md" >}}).

I'll leave the whining about my body's uncooperative response for another post. With the injuries I'm having my biggest problem was maintaining fitness in preparation for upcoming races. And I have a new idea: the elliptical machine.

It's meant to simulate running, while putting much less strain on the motor equipment---in my case, on the foot. It also seems to be [approximating running well enough to offer the same benefits to fitness][triathlete-elliptical-machine]:

> [O]ne study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that for a group of experienced runners, four weeks of elliptical-only training yielded similar physiological and performance maintenance and improvements when compared to run-only training.

The ellipticals I have in my gym offer two dimensions to adjust the training load:

* level---the higher, the more force I need to put into moving, which can approximate running uphill,
* stride length---the shorter, the fewer "steps" I'll make, which can approximate running faster.

Perfect. Conveniently, TomTom just released an update for my Spark watch, adding [Personalized Workouts][tomtom-personalized-workouts]---essentially a way to program complex, interval-based workouts into the watch, that I can later follow in training.

I'm now trying to combine both---the workouts and the elliptical machine. These sessions do [pack a punch][strava-elliptical-intervals] with my heart-rate floating between 150 and 180bpm. We'll see what the outcome will be, at latest during the race on November 11. If my injury is indeed a fracture, I may not be able to do a regular run until then, so if I can still clock in a good result, that'll be almost exclusively because of the elliptical machine.
