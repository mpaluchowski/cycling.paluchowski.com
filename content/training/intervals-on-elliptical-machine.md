I got injured. _Again_, I know. It's a different leg part this time, though. And while recovering, I'm trying out a new approach to maintaining, perhaps even building fitness, by doing intervals on the elliptical machine.

The injured part this time is, for the first time ever, my __left foot__. Three weeks ago, [recapping the Biegnij Warszawo run]({{< relref "races/biegnij-warszawo-2017/recap.md" >}}), I reported that my ankle had been painful in the morning and that I decided to race nonetheless. Unsurprisingly, that ankle felt worse the next day, but not drastically so. I took it easy for the rest of the week and thought I'd be fine shortly.

The ankle seems mostly fine by now, but last week the mid-outer part of the same foot started bugging me. A sharp pain when I apply pointed pressure to it, especially after sitting still for a while. I did a jump test, landing on it a few times and yes, that did feel painful too. Judging from the symptoms, it __might be a stress fracture__, which means __time off running for six weeks__. _Uh_. Just in time when I signed up for another [10K at Bieg Niepodległości in November]({{<relref "/races/bieg-niepodleglosci-2017/_index.md" >}}).

I'll leave the whining about my body's deficiencies for another post. The biggest problem with the injuries I'm having is maintaining fitness. My new idea for tackling that is the elliptical machine.

It's constructed to approximate running, while putting much less strain on the musculoskeletal system. It also seems to [offer the __same benefits to fitness__][triathlete-elliptical-machine]:

> [O]ne study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that for a group of experienced runners, four weeks of elliptical-only training yielded similar physiological and performance maintenance and improvements when compared to run-only training.

The ellipticals in my gym offer two ways of adjusting training load:

* __level__---the higher, the more force I need to apply, which can simulate running uphill,
* __stride length__---the shorter, the more "strides" I'll make, which can simulate running faster.

Perfect. Conveniently, TomTom just released an update for my Spark watch, adding [Personalized Workouts][tomtom-personalized-workouts]---essentially a way to program complex, interval-based workouts, that I can later follow.

I'm now trying to combine both---the workouts and the elliptical machine. These sessions do [pack a punch][strava-elliptical-intervals], with my heart-rate floating between 150 and 180bpm. We'll see what the results will be, hopefully during the November 11 race (providing my foot recovers). I will likely not be doing any real running until then, so any decent result will be only thanks to the elliptical sessions.
