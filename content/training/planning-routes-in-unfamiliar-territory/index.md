- criteria
  - good asphalt
  - little traffic
  - great views
  - bonus: coffee

  - verify nonetheless; surfaces get tricky
  - others' rides on Strava
    - edit > create route from ride
  - bikemap.net
- look for non-numbered roads
  - less traffic
  - thinner on the map
- Google StreetView for surface
  - usually ride only where there's asphalt
    - check randomly for cobblestones or pot holes
  - not available everywhere
    - ie. Germany
    - OpenStreetMap cycling view
      - still check specific street features for surface indication
