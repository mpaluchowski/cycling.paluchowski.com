Smooth asphalt, low traffic, great views and maybe coffee, if I'm lucky, are what I aim for when planning rides. Tough when I don't know the are I'll be riding, ie. when I travel. Beginnings were hit or miss and I often landed in potholes or on gravel roads, but with time I worked out the tools and strategies that *usually* take me where I want.

My first rule of thumb: **steal, when you can**. People who often ride in a given area know it best and being brag-hungry as most of them are, their rides are available on Strava. Whenever I see someone did an interesting ride, be that near Warsaw or elsewhere I may want to visit one day, I'll use Strava's ride-to-route feature and store that route for later reference.

Another great source of routes are races. There are tens of these throughout the season in Poland alone. Each one will publish their route, which you can bet was designed with local knowledge, then tested and checked for safety and road surface quality.

Then there's a number of services that offer route mapping and cataloging. My favorite one here is bikemap.net, but I also frequently see people use ridewithgps. On Bikemap.net I can search for a starting location, routes tagged with Road, browse the results and copy or save them in my personal catalog. There's a feature for rating routes, so technically a higher-rated one should be better, but in reality, few routes have any ratings or any meaningful number of them.

Finally, I do a lot of planning on my own. Either because I'm unable to find a suitable route to copy from anywhere, or more often because I want to build something based on a few route ideas I find. I often see people mark routes suboptimally, taking roads that are needlessly crowded with cars, where the maps tell me they could be avoided.

How do I choose roads? First, I prefer roads that have no numbers on the map. Major roads have numbers and these normally have higher traffic, which I'm trying to avoid. With the non-numbered roads though there's always the risk of hitting a bad surface with potholes or something unpaved altogether.

OpenStreetMap helps here. Turn on the Cycling layer and most of the unpaved roads are shown with dashed lines, whereas solid lines are for paved roads---but these could still be cobblestones or similar! So then there's Google StreetView to the rescue. Their cars will *normally* not venture off asphalt (and I do stress *normally* because I found places where that is not true), so if there's a StreetView trail on a given road, it's probably solid. Then you can see the actual photos and judge the surface yourself. On longer stretches I check a few random locations to reduce the risk of running into a bad road.

Unfortunately, Google StreetView is often grossly outdated---I saw photos shot in 2011 lately, now that's 2019---and it's not available everywhere---a major blank spot in Europe being the ever-privacy-minded Germany. My last resort here is using the satellite photos from Google Maps and hoping they have a recent, high-resolution shot available. Asphalt has this characteristic grey color so it's not too hard to spot on these photos, providing a given road is not covered by trees.

Even with all the above resources available, there's still always risk that some map or photo was incorrect or outdated. Often times I hit road works that I need to circumvent or uncomfortably ride through, and I haven't find a good place online to check for them. Yes, maps like Waze tend to cover these well on major roads, but on the minor ones there's much less of a chance that someone will report them simply because there's little traffic moving there.
