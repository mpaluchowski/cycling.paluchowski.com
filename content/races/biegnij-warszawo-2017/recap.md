Woohoo! Strava tells me this was my best 10K result ever. That's probably true, but it was also the first time I finished this distance without any issues. No bonk, no colic, no dehydration, and solid form throughout. Even the climb on Spacerowa Str. wasn't that big a deal.

## Results

## Conditions

__Sunny and cool__, around 9C when we left home and close to __12C at the start__. We were asked to dress in the race's official t-shirt---short-sleeved and very light---which I feared would be too little to stay warm, especially while waiting for the start. Sunlight solved my worries. Starting blocks were well exposed and I was even feeling _too_ warm at times.

My __left ankle felt stiff and a bit painful__ from the moment I woke up. Surprising, because I didn't do anything particularly hard on the legs for the whole previous week---a short [5K run on Wednesday][strava-wed-run] and a [very light ride on Saturday][strava-sat-ride]. For a moment I __considered withdrawing from the race__, but I really didn't want to waste yet another one. Over the last year I resigned, last minute, from two 10K races because of injuries.

## Course Recap

Getting 10,000 runners into their starting blocks takes time, so we had to wait some 20 minutes for the first gun at 12:00, then another 12 minutes for our wave's turn. I estimated being able to complete the course in around 55min, so we chose the last of the four start sectors.

I started easy, trying to balance the effort and save energy for the climb at Spacerowa Str. after the 3rd kilometer. I was satisfied to see that "easy" was __around the 5:20 pace mark__, which if I could sustain, would land me right at the 55min finish target.

Some of the runners, surprisingly, turned to walking just a few hundred meters into the race. People sometimes severely misjudge what it takes to complete a race.

The __climb wasn't bad__. I slowed down to a 6:00 pace, watched my breathing closely and ran right through it. My heart rate stayed higher for the remainder of the race, but still within reasonable limits.

Around the 6th kilometer I noticed having slowed down to around 5:40, so I pushed a bit and sped up. Turns out I __had plenty of energy left__, and with less than 4km remaining, decided there wasn't much to save for. I completed the next three kilometers at 5:16, 5:12 and 5:08 respectively.

Everyone around me at this point probably concluded the same and sped up considerably. It was much harder now to pass other runners the way I could in the beginning.

Then came the __final kilometer__, with a relatively steep run down Górnośląska and Myśliwiecka streets. Everyone pressed hard here and I also used the terrain to speed up to a 4:41 pace. Out of the curve, facing Łazienkowska Str. I could already see the finish line, so I gave all I had left, well into Zone 5, passing the finish line at a pace of around 4:02.

## Conclusions

I can certainly improve beyond this race's result. All it takes is some regularity in training, which I was [missing during the last season]({{< relref "training/2017-season-recap.md">}}).

My take-aways from this race:

1. It's brilliant to run in a pack. While the run really felt crowded, it's still much better than running through empty streets when I'm one of the last racers finishing a triathlon.
1. I really need to take my own water for 10K+ races. For this one I didn't, relying on the single aid station around the 5th kilometer, but I would've had a better result with a stable supply of fluids.
1. Regularity trumps frequency in training. I see much better results after the last few weeks from fewer runs and rides, than I had in early 2017 with more weekly hours spent in training.

Need to investigate:

1. My left ankle needs some extra care. It's noticeably more painful the next day, but without any swelling. I'll let it rest for a week or so.
