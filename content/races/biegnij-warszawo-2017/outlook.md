This is going to be _fun_. I'm still enjoying [my post-season break]({{< relref "training/2017-season-recap.md" >}}), so I've no pressure whatsover to perform. I want to finish, enjoy it all the way and take advantage of the forecasted sunny weather. I'm guessing many of the other 13,000 participants see it the same way.

This'll be, by far, the biggest sports event I ever did. At least until the [Independence Run in November]({{< relref "races/bieg-niepodleglosci-2017/_index.md" >}}), which'll have 18,000 participants.

## Course profile

It's a [downtown, all-asphalt 10K][biegnij-warszaw-trasa]. Nothing special for anyone who's doing some running. Then again, I had my ass kicked a little over a year ago at the same distance, by a limping, elderly runner. Just because I messed up nutrition. 10Ks require some fitness and tend to gather the more serious crowd of runners.

This course has one special segment---a [1km-long, 2%-grade climb along Spacerowa Street][strava-spacerowa], with a total elevation difference of approximately 30m. This one is sure to verify some of the runners, and with correct pacing it's _the_ place to gain advantage.

The rest is mostly flat and not too winding, with the final kilometer leading down the same elevation it climbed earlier.

## Strategy

Just enough to finish in good shape. The segment at Spacerowa will be tricky. I want to run all the way, so I'll need to watch my heart rate and keep it below the anaerobic threshold. It'll also put extra strain on tendons and muscles, and with my history of injuries I'll need to watch the signals coming from my legs.

There's also the final kilometer, running downhill on tired legs. Again, looks like an injury-producing segment.

My fitness is still crap. I've only lately started doing decent [runs at a pace of around 5:30/km][strava-sep-21-run], and it'll take me a few months to rebuild what I lost this year. For this race, if I manage to pace myself correctly, and not mess up the eating before, I should be able to finish around the 5:45/km average.

I'll take some fuel with me---a gel sachette for before the run, and a small bottle of isotonic drink. There will be a drink station around the 5th kilometer, but I like to have a bottle with me so that I can sip from it slowly rather than gulp down whole cups between the aid station and drop zone.
