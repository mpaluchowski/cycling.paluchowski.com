This is going to be _fun_. I'm still enjoying [my post-season break]({{< relref "training/2017-season-recap.md" >}}), so I've no pressure whatsover to perform. I want to finish, enjoy it all the way and take advantage of the forecasted sunny weather. Together with the 13,000 or so other runners.

## Course profile

It's a [downtown, all-asphalt 10K][biegnij-warszaw-trasa]. Nothing special for anyone who's doing some running, but then again, I had my ass kicked a little over a year ago at the same sitance, by a limping, elderly runner. Just because I messed up nutrition. 10Ks require some fitness and tend to gather the more serious set of runners.

This course has one special segment---a [1km-long, 2%-grade climb along Spacerowa Street][strava-spacerowa], with a total elevation difference of around 30m. This one is sure to verify some of the runners, but with proper pacing it's the place to gain advantage.

The rest is flat and not too winding.

## Strategy

Just enough to finish in good shape. The segment at Spacerowa will be tricky. I want to run all the way, not having to slow down to walking, or worse having to stop on the way. It'll also put extra strain on tendons and muscles, and with my history of injuries I'll need to watch the signals coming from my legs.

My fitness is still crap. I've only lately started doing decent [runs at a pace of around 5:30/km][strava-sep-21-run], and it'll take me a few months to rebuild what I had before. If I manage to pacemyself correctly, and not mess up with eating before, I should be able to finish this around the 5:45min/km average.
