Not bad. Turns out [elliptical training]({{< relref "training/intervals-on-elliptical-machine.md" >}}) works pretty well, and not only did I finish this in good shape, but I also beat [my result from a month ago]({{< relref "races/biegnij-warszawo-2017/recap.md" >}}) by almost three minutes. If this continues, I might be able to go below the 50-minute mark early next year.

## Results

{{< strava-activity id="1270307740" hash="2dcb99f8fd4b3f895adc8c8bce2c5fe17d3ec6aa" >}}

## Conditions

__Cold, mostly dry.__ Temperature wasn't that bad, somewhere close to 6C when we started, but the wind sent some serious chills our way. We had to wait over half an hour for our wave to start (there were 15,000 runners there with us) and trying to stay reasonably warm became a real challenge. I couldn't dress too warm because I knew I'd overheat quickly once we started. Too boost my cold resistance, I threw in some extra calories by eating an extra gel while waiting.

My left foot, which started hurting just before the [Biegnij Warszawo race]({{< relref "races/biegnij-warszawo-2017/_index.md" >}}) a month ago, still didn't recover. I did a [test run on November 5][strava-run-nov-5] to see how it responds, and didn't suffer too much afterwards, so I decided to race this time nonetheless. But I'm __not signing up for any other races until I get this in order__.

## Course Recap

Steady, good pace throughout. Before the start I was worrying about the massive crowd I'd be running in, but with three, sometimes four lanes available to us, this was not an issue. I could overtake others and be overtaken without too much hassle.

My __TomTom Spark failed me__ this time. The heart rate meter got confused and kept claiming that I wasn't even reaching Zone 1, when my body clearly showed something different. Also, because the course was surrounded by high-rise buildings, the GPS couldn't sometimes calculate my exact location and pace. You can see me "running" through a few buildings in the trail above.

My legs felt heavy around the second to third kilometers. Plus a colic tried to get at me. Both went away after a while.

I brought my own water this time, which I kept sipping throughout the race. Saved me from having to slow down at the food station and gulping down whole cups of liquid.

__I tried staying in the upper Zone 3 to low 4__ throughout the race---purely by feeling, of course, because of TomTom's failure---which amounted to a pace of 5:05 - 5:10. That worked out fine. Towards the end of the race, the last three kilometers I cautiously sped up to 4:55 - 4:50 and once I saw the finish line, even further to 4:05.

## Conclusions

It's the __best 10K I ever did__. Certainly in race, but also in training. I wasn't sure how my VO<sub>2</sub>max would work, since I was only cycling and elliptical training for the last month, but it did well. Granted, I would've preferred to reach the same result with a lower heart rate, but that's something I'll keep working on.

My take-aways from this race:

1. __Elliptical training works really well as a substitute for running__ when injured. Especially coupled with an intervals program.
1. I can certainly go below 50min on a 10K distance, if only I keep training regularly.

Need to fix:

1. My left foot, obviously. After a bit of extra research I'm pretty sure that it's not a stress fracture (thankfully), but more likely an [injury of the peroneal tendons][peroneal-tendon-injury]. I'll let the foot rest for a while and started wearing an ankle brace.
