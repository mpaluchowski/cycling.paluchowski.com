Disaster. This was by far my worst appearance *ever*. Not so much the time, but the **shape** I was in throughout the event -- unable to catch my breath after swimming, and unable to run more than 50m at a time after getting off the bike. I was struggling worse than I did at the IronMan 70.3 distance in Gdynia just a month earlier.

## Conditions

I couldn't warm up properly because the organizers scheduled the technical briefing for 11:20, then *delayed* it to 11:30. It took only 10 minutes, but even so, I barely had time to put on my wetsuit, then reach the warm-up area, when the organizers called for everyone to leave the water.

* Dry weather throughout the course, very warm in the morning, up to 27C, later partially clouded and warm at 23C. Little to no wind.
* Cool water at 20C. No waves. Good visibility of buoys and landmarks while swimming.
* Hilly bike course, with gentle and short climbs. All asphalt. Traffic closed.
* Running trail half dirt road, half asphalt, with a mild drop and climb back.

## Course Recap

Started the **swim** quickly, somewhat on the back of the main pack. Kept the pace but shortly started having digestive problems from the food I ate before the start (an energy bar). Some 200m in I detached from the main group and went slower, trying to lower my heart rate. Kept switching between front crawl and breaststroke.

Exited water with a pulse that was way too fast, and a colic. After climbing the slope right off the water had to stop for a minute to catch my breath before heading for the transition zone. Quick, flawless transition.

On the **bike** regained posture and stopped feeling the colic. Quick and smooth ride. Caught a group on one of the loops, which gave me a bit of a speed boost. Couldn't make much use of drafting because coming so late out of the swim most of the riders before me were long gone.

*Melted* down on the **run**. Felt massive cramps in my quads *and* hamstrings right off the bike. Colic returned too, plus signs of high blood pressure -- ears getting stuck and I could hear my breathing as if I had empty space in my head. Tried to stretch out the thigh cramps and after about 2km they were mostly gone. Colic remained with me for the rest of the trail and, combined with legs being tired, and probably the fatigue from high blood pressure, didn't let me run for longer than 50-100m at a time. I probably did more walking then running at this stage.

## Conclusions

This clearly isn't the way to complete a triathlon. I was considering resigning shortly after starting the run, but decided to continue only because I knew I wasn't doing myself any serious harm and that I would finish within the time limit. But this sort of suffering is pointless and I can't let myself have another race experience like this one.

I *may* have had a "bad day". Always a viable explanation, but I like to think in terms of cause and effect. Even "bad days" have their reasons, some of which should be within my control.

My take-aways from this race:

1. Eating solid food shortly before the swim is a bad idea. Try gels and drinks next time when having a late start.
1. Start the swim easy. Pace yourself better.
1. Get a swimming coach and get faster. I tried on my own and haven't gotten anywhere.
1. Spend more time training muscular endurance and anaerobic endurance. I focused too much on distance and aerobic endurance this season and missed out on speed.

Need to investigate:

1. The repeating quad and hamstring cramps. It shouldn't be a matter of insufficient magnesium, because I was taking extra supplements for a few days before the race. A matter of more training aimed at muscular endurance?

[^1]: Official results didn't separate transition times from the racing legs, so I had to do some math and the numbers here are slightly inaccurate.
